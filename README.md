# Introduction

Repository of algorithms to analyze data about prediction of rain correlated to runoff from rain excess. The goal is to develop an API to feed a react native based app. Our goal is to predict flood using this data.

The dataset used in the development was the daily accumulated precipitation since 1998-2018 in millimetres. It can be accessed by this [link](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/jobs/results/5bcb573aeff6bc8a46d3d6f4).
