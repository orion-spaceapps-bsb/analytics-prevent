# Introduction

Repository of algorithms to analyze data about prediction of rain correlated to runoff from rain excess. The goal is to develop an APIto feed a react native based app. Our goal is to predict flood using this data.

This is a single file server, the dataset used in the development was the daily accumulated precipitation since 1998-2018 in millimetres. It can be accessed by this [link](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/jobs/results/5bcb573aeff6bc8a46d3d6f4).

## To run

You need to ```pip install``` all dependencies listed in the ```server.py``` file.
Run ```python3 server.py```, this up the server to acess endpoints.
