# Introduction

Repository of algorithms to analyze data about prediction of rain correlated to runoff from rain excess. The goal is to develop an API to feed a react native based app. Our goal is to predict flood using this data.

The dataset used in the development was the daily accumulated precipitation since 1998-2018 in millimetres. It can be accessed by this [link](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=TRMM_3B43D&date=2016-08-01).
